# parallax-3d-lens-effect

The demonstration how to create the 3D parallax effect when moving mouse using the CSS `transform`.

In JavaScript, we only need to listen the mousemove event and set the transformation values into CSS variables.
The background "rain effect" is created with canvas and animated using JavaScript.

To generate static HTML with assets from their source files is used the [html-bundler-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/webdiscus/html-bundler-webpack-plugin).

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img src="docs/images/parallax-3d-lens-effect.gif" alt="Parallax 3D lens effect demo">
</div>

> This example uses the assets created by @agragregra WebDesign Master.
